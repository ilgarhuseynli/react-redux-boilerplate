## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
npm install
```

## Scripts

Here are the scripts available for managing and running the application:

- **Start the development server**:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
  This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

- **Build the project for production**:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
  This will create an optimized production build in the `build` folder.

- **Run tests**:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
  Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

- **Eject the project**:
  ```bash
  npm run eject
  ```
  This exposes the underlying configuration files. **Caution: This action is irreversible.**

## Features

- **State Management**: Managed using `@reduxjs/toolkit` and `react-redux` for a simplified and scalable approach.
- **API Integration**: Axios is used for handling HTTP requests.
- **Styling**: Built using `bootstrap` for responsiveness and `antd` for UI components.
- **Custom Configuration**: CRACO enables modifications to the Webpack configuration without ejecting the app.

## Configuration

1. **Redux Setup**:
   The application state is managed using Redux Toolkit. You can find slices under the `src/features` directory.

2. **Axios Setup**:
   API service files are located in `src/services`, and the Axios instance is pre-configured for easier integration.

3. **Styling**:
    - Add custom global styles in the `src/styles` folder.
    - Use Ant Design components for consistent UI.
